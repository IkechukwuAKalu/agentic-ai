- Notable sales:  
  - Jan 12: 310 units (revenue: 18900.7)  
  - Jan 13: 302 units  
  - Jan 14: 305 units  
  - Jan 15: 301 units  
  - Jan 16: 226 units  
- Observation: The peak occurs on Jan 12 with a significant jump from prior days (which ranged between 226-310 units).  
- Price analysis: Consistent at $60.97; competitor prices varied but no drastic changes. On Jan 12, a notable competitor price drop occurred (CompetitorB and C offered discounts).  
- Promotion: No scheduled promotion for Jan 12, but a "Flash Sale" started on Jan 15-16, which did not influence Jan 12 sales.  
- Hypothesis: The spike on Jan 12 is likely driven by natural demand increase, possibly influenced by competitor discounting, but no explicit promotion or weather impact.

**2. Product 2 (P002):**  
- Notable sales:  
  - Jan 11: 86 units (up from 65 the previous day)  
  - Jan 12: 80 units (slight decrease)  
  - Jan 15: 73 units (down from Jan 14's 84 units)  
  - Jan 16: 80 units  
- Observation: The highest sales on Jan 11 (86 units).  
- Price: Stable at $35.34; competitor prices: significant discounts on Jan 11 (27% off from CompetitorB, 21% off from C).  
- Promotion: No scheduled promotion for Jan 11; on Jan 12, a "Weekend Special" (10% off) was active from Jan 12-14, but sales on Jan 11 predates that.  
- Hypothesis: The increase on Jan 11 correlates with competitor discounts, possibly attracting customers despite no scheduled promotion.

  - Jan 12: 108 units (highest)

- Observation: Peak on Jan 12, with a significant increase from previous days (Jan 11: 79, Jan 13: 96).  
- Price: Stable at $81.13; competitor discounts on Jan 12 (27% off from B, 21% from C) align with the sales spike.  
- Promotion: No scheduled promotion; weather conditions: heavy rain on Jan 12 might have affected shopping behavior, but the data suggests discounts played a bigger role.  
- Hypothesis: Competitor discounts on Jan 12 likely drove the sales spike.

- Promotion: No scheduled promotion for Jan 14, but a "Flash Sale" started Jan 15-16.  
- Weather: No adverse conditions; the spike on Jan 14 coincides with competitor discounting.

- Price: Stable at $26.95; competitor discounts on Jan 12 (17% off from A, 21% from C) coincide with the spike.  
- Promotion: No scheduled promotion on Jan 12; weather: heavy rain and flood warning, which could have affected shopping behavior, but the data shows a sharp increase aligned with competitor discounts.  
- Hypothesis: The significant spike on Jan 12 is primarily driven by competitor discounts, possibly combined with weather conditions prompting more immediate purchases.

### **Key pattern:**  
The most prominent sales spikes across products correlate strongly with days when competitor discounts and pricing strategies were aggressive, often with discounts ranging from 17% to 27%. Weather conditions like heavy rain and flood warnings appear less directly correlated with spikes, except possibly for Product 5, where the flood warning on Jan 12 coincided with a massive increase, suggesting emergency or urgent purchase behavior.

# **CONCLUSION:**

The largest observed spike is for **Product 5 (P005)** on **2024-01-12** with **342 units** sold, which is significantly higher than typical daily sales.
